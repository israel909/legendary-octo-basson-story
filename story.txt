Once upon a time there was a man named John. He lived in the city. 

Cody: In the city, he met a beautiful woman. They hit it off and had a great time on their
first date. After the date, as he was walking her home, the city started to glitch like
a broken TV. He began questioning his reality as he saw himself begin to start dissapearing
into a glitch. He then woke up in an interesting place. 

Ella: He woke up in an abandoned wearhouse. Turns out, this beautiful woman, was actually
a spy with a mission. She had drugged his drink during their meal and then waiting until
he became unconcious in order to continue her mission. John had valuable knowledge and 
information that the CIA wanted.

Alice: They wanted John's recipe for pink glazed donuts with sprinkles on top.
Little did they know that John was in fact not a man, but an AI that controlled
the world. John was designed by CIA's rival agency, the Agency for Information 
Control in order to guard the secret for the world's best donut and had a 
fail-safe:  if anyone drugged him, he would start erasing parts of the world 
starting with the recipe.
